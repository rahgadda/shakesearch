# ShakeSearch

Hey guys, this is a response repository for a take home challenge available [here](https://github.com/ProlificLabs/shakesearch)

In this repository, you'll find a my simple web app that allows a user to search for a text string in the complete works of Shakespeare.

Sample live version is available at [pulley-shakesearch](https://pulley-shakesearch.herokuapp.com/).   
My implementation is available at [rahgadda-shakesearch()   

Try searching for "Hamlet" to display a set of results.
